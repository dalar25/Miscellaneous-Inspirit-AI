While the raw data ([downloaded from here](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/)) was specified in the OSM XML Format, we have done a little bit of pre-processing to convert the data to a format that is slightly easier to work with.\n",

        "As in the original format, we have divided the data into two separate pieces: a list of \"nodes\" (representing individual locations) and a list of \"ways\" (representing roads or other kinds of connections between nodes). We've changed it up a bit from that. In it's current format, our data is stored in two dictionaries: \n",

        "\n",

        "`sort` also takes in two optional parameters: \n",

        "list_name.sort(reverse=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "If you set `reverse` to `True`, the sorted list will be in **descending** order, aka high value to low value. If you set it to `False` or don't set it at all, the sorted list will be in **ascending order**, aka low value to high value.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The format is something you're probably not used to. It uses what's called an **inline** or **lambda** function. We're not going to go into this a ton, but you can use the examples below and in the docs as a guide.\n",
